            <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.</p>

            <p>At the command line, first verify that you have Git installed:
            
            On all operating systems:<code>git --version</code> If nothing is returned, or the command is not recognized, you may have to install Git on your system by
            downloading and running the installer. See the Git homepage for exceptionally clear and easy installation
            instructions.
            After installing Git, configure your username and email address. Do this before making a commit.
            Once Git is installed, navigate to the directory you want to place under version control and create an empty Git
            repository:

            <code>git init</code>

            this creates a hidden folder .git which contains the plumbing needed for Git to Work. Next, check what files Git will add to your new repository; this step is worth special care:

            <code>git status</code> 
            
            Review the resulting list of files; you can tell Git which of the files to place into version control (avoid adding files with confidential information such as passwords, or files that just clutter the repo):

            <code>git add (file directory)</code>

            This will "stage" all files to be added to version control, preparing them to be committed in your first commit.For files that you want never under version control, create and populate a file named .gitignore before running the add command.Commit all the files that have been added, along with a commit message:

            <code>git commit -m "initial commit"</code>

            This creates a new commit with the given message. A commit is like a save or snapshot of your entire project. You can now push, or upload, it to a remote repository, and later you can jump back to it if necessary. If you omit the -m parameter, your default editor will open and you can edit and save the commit message there.

            <p>The git clone command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a server to the local machine. For example, to clone a GitHub project:

            <code>cd (path to clone directory)</code>

            <code>git clone (GitHub repository URL)</code>

            </p>
            <p>This creates a directory called projectname on the local machine, containing all the files in the remote Git repository. This includes source files for the project, as well as a .git sub-directory which contains the entire history and configuration for the project.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Sharing Code">Sharing Code</header>

            <p>To share your code you create a repository on a remote server to which you will copy your local repository.To minimize the use of space on the remote server you create a bare repository: one which has only the .git objects and doesn't create a working copy in the filesystem. As a bonus you set this remote as an upstream server to easily share updates with other programmers. On the remote server:

            <code>git init --bare (path)</code></p>

            <header id="Set Username and Email">Set Username and Email</header>
            
            <p>You need to set who you are *before* creating any commit. That will allow commits to have the right author name and email associated to them. It has nothing to do with authentication when pushing to a remote repository (e.g. when pushing to a remote repository using your GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab account) To declare that identity for all repositories, use git config --global This will store the setting in your user's .gitconfig file: e.g. $HOME/.gitconfig or for Windows %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig.
            </p>
            <p>To declare an identity for a single repository, use git config inside a repo. This will store the setting inside the individual repository, in the file $GIT_DIR/config. e.g. /path/to/your/repo/.git/config.
                <code>cd (path)</code>

                <code>git config user .name (Login)</code>

                <code>git config user .email (email)</code>
            </p>
            <p>Settings stored in a repository's config file will take precedence over the global config when you use that repository. Tips: if you have different identities (one for open-source project, one at work, one for private repos, ...), and you don't want to forget to set the right one for each different repos you are working on.</p>
